== How to contribute

* Before you create a pull request, please create first a Github issue for the feature you would like to add or for the thing you want to change in this library
** We will then have first a discussion before you start changing the code
** This will save time both for you and me and we will reach faster an agreement for the change you intend
* Please create separate issues for separate things
* Please create separate pull requests for separate issues

== The release process

* In your local IDE
** check that the local branch is up-to-date
** Check everything (code, docs, ...) is fine in the repo and ready to release
** Write/check the release notes in `next_releasenotes_draft.md`
** Set the version in `build.gradle`
** Commit and push
** run gradle task `uploadArchives` locally
* Check the newly created staging repo in https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories
** are the artifacts ok?
** is the pom correct?
** If not, drop the staging repo, fix whatever needs a fix and try again
** If everything is fine
*** Do `close` the staging respository (takes a couple of seconds, this will check the artifacts)
*** Do `release` the staging respository
*** After 10 - 15 minutes the new artifacts should be available on Maven Central
* Create manually in the Github webpage a new release under "releases" / "Draft a new release"
** set the git tag with the version from `build.gradle`
** set the release title with the version from `build.gradle`
** use the text from `next_releasenotes_draft.md` for the release description
** click "publish release"
* In your local IDE
** Update your local branch (git pull)
** Set the version in `build.gradle` to the next SNAPSHOT version
** Clear `next_releasenotes_draft.md`
** Commit and push
